are no current plans to bring it back into stock in this market. Code 06 does not specifically imply that returns are or are
not still accepted

representative (local publisher or sales agent) will not accept orders for it, though stock may still be available elsewhere
in the supply chain, and (b) the product will not be made available again in this market under the same ISBN. Code 07 normally
implies that the publisher will not accept returns beyond a specified date

(local publisher or sales agent) will not accept orders for it, though stock may still be available elsewhere in the supply
chain. Code 08 covers both of codes 06 and 07, and may be used where the distinction between those values is either unnecessary
or meaningless

is split between exclusive sales agents for different market segments. In ONIX 2.1, should be accompanied by a free-text statement
in &lt;MarketRestrictionDetail&gt; describing the nature of the restriction. In ONIX 3.0, the &lt;SalesRestriction&gt; composite in Group
P.24 should be used
