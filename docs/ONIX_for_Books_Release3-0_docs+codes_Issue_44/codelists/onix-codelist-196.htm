the more specific conformance and feature details provided. The summary should note both the accessibility features provided
and any potential deficiencies. More detailed information may be provided using codes 94&#8211;96. For use in ONIX 3.0 only. See
also code 00 for a summary of the accessibility features of the product itself

text size or typeface, choice of text or background color, text-to-speech) are disabled, overridden or otherwise unusable
with the product EXCEPT &#8211; in ONIX 3 messages only &#8211; those specifically noted as subject to restriction or prohibition in &lt;EpubUsageConstraint&gt;.
Note that provision of any significant part of the textual content as images (ie as pictures of text, rather than as text)
inevitably prevents use of these accessibility options

audio or video content may be directly accessible from the Table of contents, or from a similar List of illustrations, List

content should include alternative descriptions suitable for hearing-impaired as well as for visually-impaired readers. (Purely
decorative non-text content can be ignored, but the accessibility of resources delivered via a network connection rather than
as part of the e-publication package must be included)
