or market-wide embargo date, the date from which the embargo is lifted and retail sales and fulfillment of pre-orders are
permitted. Use code 02 here ONLY in the exceptional case when the embargo is supplier-specific. More general market-wide or
global sales embargos should be specified in &lt;MarketDate&gt; or &lt;PublishingDate&gt; codes. In the absence of any supplier-specific,
market-wide or general embargo date, retail sales and pre-order fulfillment may begin as soon as stock is available to the
retailer
